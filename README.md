## 🌟 Project Overview

**VPCore Infrastructure Project** is a comprehensive AWS cloud infrastructure solution that demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** with associated AWS services. This project showcases best practices for cloud architecture, networking, security, and infrastructure as code.

The project implements a scalable, secure, and highly available cloud infrastructure using Amazon Web Services, focusing on VPC configuration, EC2 instances, security groups, and automated deployment through shell scripting.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project deploys a multi-tier AWS infrastructure architecture that includes:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** - Isolated network environment
- **Public and Private Subnets** - Distributed across multiple Availability Zones
- **Internet Gateway** - For public internet access
- **NAT Gateway** - For secure outbound internet access from private subnets
- **Security Groups and NACLs** - Network-level security controls
- **EC2 Instances** - Compute resources in both public and private subnets

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose | Version |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **AWS VPC** | Virtual Private Cloud networking | Latest |
| **Amazon EC2** | Elastic Compute Cloud instances | Latest |
| **AWS CLI** | Command-line interface for AWS services | 2.x |
| **Shell Scripting** | Infrastructure automation and deployment | Bash |
| **Linux** | Operating system for EC2 instances | Ubuntu/Amazon Linux |

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before deploying this infrastructure, ensure you have:

### Required Tools
- **AWS Account** with appropriate IAM permissions
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured
- **SSH Key Pair** for EC2 instance access
- **Bash Shell** environment for running scripts

### Required AWS Permissions
- VPC management permissions
- EC2 instance management
- Security Group and NACL management
- IAM role permissions for resource access

### Installation Commands
```
# Install AWS CLI
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/MOHITRAJDEO12345/VPCore-Infra-Project.git
cd VPCore-Infra-Project
```

### 2. Configure AWS Credentials
```
aws configure set aws_access_key_id YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws configure set aws_secret_access_key YOUR_SECRET_KEY
aws configure set default.region us-east-1
```

### 3. Make Scripts Executable
```
chmod +x *.sh
```

### 4. Deploy Infrastructure
```
# Deploy VPC and associated resources
./deploy-vpc.sh

# Launch EC2 instances
./launch-instances.sh
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### VPC Configuration Parameters
```
{
  "VpcCidrBlock": "10.0.0.0/16",
  "PublicSubnetCidr": "10.0.1.0/24",
  "PrivateSubnetCidr": "10.0.2.0/24",
  "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1a",
  "Region": "us-east-1"
}
```

### EC2 Instance Specifications
- **Instance Type**: t2.micro (Free Tier eligible)
- **AMI**: Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu Server
- **Storage**: 8GB EBS General Purpose SSD
- **Security**: Custom security groups with minimal required access

## 🔒 Security Features

This project implements AWS security best practices:

- **Network Isolation**: VPC with public and private subnets
- **Access Control**: Security groups with least privilege principles
- **Network ACLs**: Additional network-level security layer
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Secure instance access
- **Private Subnet Isolation**: Database and backend services in private subnets

## 📊 Monitoring and Management

The infrastructure includes monitoring capabilities for:

- **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic monitoring
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Instance and network performance
- **Resource Tracking**: Automated resource usage reporting

## 🧪 Testing

### Infrastructure Validation
```
# Test VPC connectivity
./test-connectivity.sh

# Validate security groups
./validate-security.sh

# Check resource status
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name]'
```

## 📈 Cost Optimization

This project is designed with cost optimization in mind:

- Uses **t2.micro** instances (Free Tier eligible)
- Implements **resource tagging** for cost tracking
- Provides **cleanup scripts** for resource decommissioning
- Follows **AWS Well-Architected Framework** principles

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**SSH Connection Refused**
```
# Check security group settings
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId,IpPermissions]'
```

**Internet Gateway Not Attached**
```
# Verify IGW attachment
aws ec2 describe-internet-gateways
```
